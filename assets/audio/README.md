# Audio Assets Needed

## Music
- `menu_music.ogg` - Background music for main menu and menus
- `gameplay_music.ogg` - Background music during gameplay

## Sound Effects
- `card_navigation.wav` - Sound when navigating between cards (swoosh)
- `button_click.wav` - Sound when selecting/confirming with Space
- `correct_answer.wav` - Success chime when answering correctly
- `wrong_answer.wav` - Error buzz when answering incorrectly
- `life_lost.wav` - Sound when losing a life
- `phase_complete.wav` - Sound when completing a phase
- `victory.wav` - Victory fanfare
- `defeat.wav` - Defeat sound
- `timer_warning.wav` - Beep sound for last 10 seconds (not implemented yet)

## Notes
- Music files should be in OGG format for better compression
- Sound effects can be WAV or OGG
- All files should be imported into Godot with appropriate loop settings
- Menu music should loop
- Gameplay music should loop
- All sound effects should not loop

## Temporary Workaround
The game will function without audio files, but audio functionality is commented with TODO markers in the code for easy addition later.
